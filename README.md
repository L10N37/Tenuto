# WHO'S THAT?
<br />

<br />

## Concept:
the concept of this project was to use the spotify api to send a request and also get a response from the api to show the artist and there top 10 songs
and if we had more time was to also get the youtube link to the artists (via youtube api)
<br />

<br />

## Process:
The api we use was from spotify, which allowed us to grab a authentication token everytime we pressed the search button. We broke down  the tasks/roles of the project down to its simple MVP (minimul viable product) which was getting the spotify api to work (as in sending a fetch and getting a response from the api), getting the search results to show on screen aswell as getting the images, samples and the ablum name/title. for assigned roles we had everyone do a bit of everything ( as in everyone one done a bit of HTML, CSS, and javascript). Some of the challenges we ran into were getting the spotify api to actully work from the start due to getting the authorsization token from the api as well as getting the response from the api, also trying to get the artist name and photo to show up with the relevant info, also getting the artist to be removed once you searched up a new artist, we also ran into the problem that of getting the album photos to aligne with each other so it doesnt just go down the page. We succeded in almost all the challenges but had a few bugs that had to be ironed out but other than that we were able to accomplish almost all of our goals exept for the youtube api due to running out of time.

## Usage
if you wanna know what an artists top 10 song are you can search up the name for the artist,
but if you try to search up the song of an artist it wont come up with anything due to it not being an artist in the spotify api
<br />

<br />

## Features
You are able to search up any artist with there top 10 songs aswell as a sample if there is one
